<h2>How to RUN Script:</h2>

Currently, we support CLI commands and Script file

    load image-path image-name  
    save image-path image-name  
    red-component image-name dest-image-name  
    green-component image-name dest-image-name  
    blue-component image-name dest-image-name  
    value-component image-name dest-image-name  
    luma-component image-name dest-image-name  
    intensity-component image-name dest-image-name  
    horizontal-flip image-name dest-image-name  
    vertical-flip image-name dest-image-name  
    brighten alpha image-name dest-image-name 
    darken alpha image-name dest-image-name 
    rgb-split image-name dest-image-name-red dest-image-name-green dest-image-name-blue  
    rgb-combine image-name red-image green-image blue-image  
    blur image-name dest-image-name  
    sharpen image-name dest-image-name  
    sepia image-name dest-image-name  

To Run a script file use the below command:
<p><h3> run Path-to-script-file</h3>

Sample Script File (Requires Replacing Image path and destination as per your machine):

    load <inputFilePath> test
    red-component test redImage
    green-component test greenImage
    blue-component test blueImage
    value-component test valueImage

                - `Visualize`: Manages requests to visualization functions (RGB component, luma,
                  intensity, and value).
            - **Classes**:
                - `CombineRGB`: Combines three images into one RGB image and validates dimensions
                  and values.
                - `Load`: Loads a given image from the path and uses the reader based on the image
                  format.
                - `Save`: Saves the image to the given path by converting it to a buffered image
                  before using the `ImageIO` JDK.

### CHANGES(Assignment - 5):

1. New operations added: Compress, Histogram, Color Correction, Levels Adjustment.**(No design
   changes required.)**
    - The existing codebase remained unaltered to incorporate the new operations. Instead,
      we extended the system's functionality by introducing new command classes and their
      corresponding model classes. This approach allowed us to seamlessly integrate additional
      features without modifying the core structure, adhering to the principles of modularity and
      extensibility in software design.
    - For Every new operation we extended the ImageOperation.java interface and override the apply
      method with the new logics.
    - For new corresponding controllers, we have implemented the CLIOperations.java and extended the
      AbstractOperation.java abstract class tha contains the common validation and delegation
      logics.
2. We made few refactoring **as we hit the file limit(125)**. Following were the changes,
    - Removed the FileReader.java class. Moved the readFile method to the controller class,
      ImageProcessorCLI.java
    - Removed the individual controller classes for the operations such as Filter.java, Blur.java
      etc.,
      and moved them to ImageOperationFactory.java as inner classes.
    - Remove FilterConstants.java and moved the constants to their corresponding usage area.
3. Package Refactoring: More meaningful organisation.
    - imageio package from ime to controller.(ime ----> ime.controller).
    - Moved ImageLibrary.java to the package Repository and moved repository to
      ime.controller.operation package.

## CHANGES(Assignment - 6)
1. No significant design changes were required to accommodate the new requirements, as our design 
   adheres to the principle of open/closed—open to extension but closed to modification. 
   We extended the existing classes to seamlessly support the new operations.
2. To incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI), a new controller and a corresponding view were 
   introduced, resulting in the creation of additional objects.
3. A past mistake in the implementation of the split command from a previous assignment was 
   corrected to ensure proper functionality.

Assignment 6 Submission:

Design of Downscale:

The addition of Downscale feature was isolated changes and did not require any change to existing
design.

+ We created the model class (Downscale.java) where the logic was implemented.
+ A new controller (Downscale) was added as inner class in the controllers containing the argument
  validation and delegation to the model.
+ As our controller follows the Command Design patter, the new Command object creation is listed in
  the switch case to create the command object based on the user request string.

New file added (Model) : ime/model/operation/Downscale.java
Inner class added (Controller) : ime/controller/operation/ImageOperationFactory.java
